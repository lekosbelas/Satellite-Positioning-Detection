# Satellite-Positioning-Detection
The competition's objective was to develop an AI model capable of identifying fixed landmarks with man-made features within the satellite images provided. These landmarks hold significance as they could serve as reference points in GNSS-independent navigation systems. The goal was to create a model that accurately and reliably detects these landmarks and test it on satellite imagery.
